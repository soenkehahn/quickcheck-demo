# Notes

- Basic Principle
  - write general properties
  - generate test data
  - shrink counterexamples
- Introductory Example: CamelCase.hs
- Gen
  - sample
  - size
- Testable class
  - `(===)`
  - `(==>)`
  - `forAll`
  - `forAllShrink`
  - `counterexample`
  - `whenFail`
- `Arbitrary` class
- General Tips:
  - Switch back and forth between
    - writing properties,
    - writing production code,
    - writing proper Gens,
    - writing proper shrinks,
    - writing proper counterexamples,
    - don't loose your patience.
  - QuickCheck is a heavyweight tool, consider writing unit tests first.
  - Don't use QuickCheck without something like hspec.
  - Writing good properties is a challenge.
  - Some good candidates for properties:
    - smoke tests
    - idempotence
    - invariants
    - comparison to a golden standard
  - Sometimes it's good to avoid `Arbitrary`.
- Bigger Example: Tree.hs
